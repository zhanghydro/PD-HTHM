# Physically Driven Hybrid Transformer Hydrological Model

This repository contains the official implementation of the **Physically Driven Hybrid Transformer Hydrological Model (PD-HTHM)**. PD-HTHM is a hybrid hydrological modeling framework developed to improve streamflow simulation under nonstationary environmental conditions. Operating at a daily timestep, it uses meteorological inputs—such as precipitation and potential evapotranspiration—and adaptively estimates time-varying hydrological parameters to capture evolving catchment responses.

The code will be gradually released in this repository. Please stay tuned for updates.
